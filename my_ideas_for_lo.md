# My ideas for LibreOffice

The below feature ideas are taken directly from MS Excel with hope they maybe
implemented in LibreOffice Calc as they are most used features in my work.

NOTE: They may be already implemented or under implementation.
This is just a dump of all possible ideas I can think of for LibreOffice.

## Desired features

* Format as table from excel
* Table properties and functions similar to excel
* Auto format best width and height for cells
* Ease of use, more visuals for most frequently used features
* App usage analytics reports. Helps in identifying what features are
  most used.

## Blog ideas

* Write about LibreOffice dev setup, dev machine requirements, build timing
* Write about LibreOffice history, significance, use cases, future, funds
* Write about LibreOffice hidden, powerful, command line only features
* Mention mailing lists and IRC chat servers.
