autogen.sh - libreoffice configuration helper
   --with-distro  use a config from distro-configs/
                  the name needs to be passed without extension
   --best-effort  don't fail on un-known configure with/enable options

Other arguments passed directly to configure:

`configure' configures LibreOffice 7.2.0.0.alpha0+ to adapt to many kinds of systems.

Usage: ./configure [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...

To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.

Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.

Configuration:
  -h, --help              display this help and exit
      --help=short        display options specific to this package
      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
  -V, --version           display version information and exit
  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print `checking ...' messages
      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
  -C, --config-cache      alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'
  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or `..']

Installation directories:
  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
                          [/usr/local]
  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
                          [PREFIX]

By default, `make install' will install all the files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/lib' etc.  You can specify
an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' using `--prefix',
for instance `--prefix=$HOME'.

For better control, use the options below.

Fine tuning of the installation directories:
  --bindir=DIR            user executables [EPREFIX/bin]

  --enable-fuzz-options   Randomly enable or disable each of those
                          configurable options that are supposed to be freely
                          selectable without interdependencies, or where bad
                          interaction from interdependencies is automatically
                          avoided.

  --enable-android-lok    The Android app from the android/ subdir needs
                          several tweaks all over the place that break the LOK
                          when used in the Online-based Android app. This
                          switch indicates that the intent of this build is
                          actually the Online-based, non-modified LOK.

                          installer of the product. Use this switch to disable
                          the integration.

  --disable-avmedia       Disable displaying and inserting AV media in
                          documents. Work in progress, use only if you are

  --disable-database-connectivity
                          Disable various database connectivity. Work in
                          progress, use only if you are hacking on it.

  --disable-extensions    Disable all add-on extension functionality. Work in
                          progress, use only if you are hacking on it.

                          use only if you are hacking on it.

  --disable-dynamic-loading
                          Disable any use of dynamic loading of code. Work in
                          progress, use only if you are hacking on it.

                          signature verification.

  --disable-skia          Disable building Skia. Use --enable-skia=debug to
                          build without optimizations.

  --enable-mergelibs      Merge several of the smaller libraries into one big,
                          "merged", one.

  --enable-breakpad       Enables breakpad for crash reporting.

  --disable-crashdump     Disable dump.ini and dump-file, when
                          --enable-breakpad

  --disable-fetch-external
                          Disables fetching external tarballs from web
                          sources.

  --enable-fuzzers        Enables building libfuzzer targets for fuzz testing.

  --enable-pch=<yes/no/system/base/normal/full>
                          Enables precompiled header support for C++. Forced
                          default on Windows/VC build. Using 'system' will
                          include only external headers, 'base' will add also
                          headers from base modules, 'normal' will also add
                          all headers except from the module built, 'full'
                          will use all suitable headers even from a module
                          itself.

  --enable-epm            LibreOffice includes self-packaging code, that
                          requires epm, however epm is useless for large scale
                          package building.

  --disable-odk           LibreOffice includes an ODK, office development kit
                          which some packagers may wish to build without.

  --enable-mpl-subset     Don't compile any pieces which are not MPL or more
                          liberally licensed

  --enable-evolution2     Allows the built-in evolution 2 addressbook
                          connectivity build to be enabled.

  --enable-avahi          Determines whether to use Avahi to advertise Impress
                          to remote controls.

  --enable-werror         Turn warnings to errors. (Has no effect in modules
                          where the treating of warnings as errors is disabled
                          explicitly.)
  --enable-assert-always-abort
                          make assert() failures abort even when building
                          without --enable-debug or --enable-dbgutil.
  --enable-dbgutil        Provide debugging support from --enable-debug and
                          include additional debugging utilities such as
                          object counting or more expensive checks. This is
                          the recommended option for developers. Note that
                          this makes the build ABI incompatible, it is not
                          possible to mix object files or libraries from a
                          --enable-dbgutil and a --disable-dbgutil build.
  --enable-debug          Include debugging information, disable compiler
                          optimization and inlining plus extra debugging code
                          like assertions. Extra large build! (enables -g
                          compiler flag).
  --disable-split-debug   Disable using split debug information (-gsplit-dwarf
                          compile flag). Split debug information saves disk
                          space and build time, but requires tools that
                          support it (both build tools and debuggers).
  --disable-gdb-index     Disables creating debug information in the gdb index
                          format, which makes gdb start faster. The feature
                          requires the gold or lld linker.
  --enable-sal-log        Make SAL_INFO and SAL_WARN calls do something even
                          in a non-debug build.
  --enable-symbols        Generate debug information. By default, enabled for
                          --enable-debug and --enable-dbgutil, disabled
                          otherwise. It is possible to explicitly specify
                          gbuild build targets (where 'all' means everything,
                          '-' prepended means to not enable, '/' appended
                          means everything in the directory; there is no
                          ordering, more specific overrides more general, and
                          disabling takes precedence). Example:
                          --enable-symbols="all -sw/ -Library_sc".
  --enable-optimized=<yes/no/debug>
                          Whether to compile with optimization flags. By
                          default, disabled for --enable-debug and
                          --enable-dbgutil, enabled otherwise. Using 'debug'
                          will try to use only optimizations that should not
                          interfere with debugging.
  --disable-runtime-optimizations
                          Statically disable certain runtime optimizations
                          (like rtl/alloc.h or JVM JIT) that are known to
                          interact badly with certain dynamic analysis tools
                          (like -fsanitize=address or Valgrind). By default,
                          disabled iff CC contains "-fsanitize=*". (For
                          Valgrind, those runtime optimizations are typically
                          disabled dynamically via RUNNING_ON_VALGRIND.)
  --enable-compiler-plugins
                          Enable compiler plugins that will perform additional
                          checks during building. Enabled automatically by
                          --enable-dbgutil. Use
                          --enable-compiler-plugins=debug to also enable debug
                          code in the plugins.
  --disable-compiler-plugins-analyzer-pch
                          Disable use of precompiled headers when running the
                          Clang compiler plugin analyzer. Not relevant in the
                          --disable-compiler-plugins case.
  --disable-ooenv         Disable ooenv for the instdir installation.
  --enable-lto            Enable link-time optimization. Suitable for
                          (optimised) product builds. Building might take
                          longer but libraries and executables are optimized
                          for speed. For GCC, best to use the 'gold' linker.
                          For MSVC, this option is broken at the moment. This
                          is experimental work in progress that shouldn't be
                          used unless you are working on it.)
  --enable-python=<no/auto/system/internal/fully-internal>
                          Enables or disables Python support at run-time. Also
                          specifies what Python to use at build-time.
                          'fully-internal' even forces the internal version
                          for uses of Python during the build. On macOS the
                          only choices are 'internal' (default) or
                          'fully-internal'. Otherwise the default is 'auto'.
  --disable-gtk3          Determines whether to use Gtk+ 3.0 vclplug on
                          platforms where Gtk+ 3.0 is available.
  --enable-introspection  Generate files for GObject introspection. Requires
                          --enable-gtk3. (Typically used by Linux
                          distributions.)
  --enable-split-app-modules
                          Split file lists for app modules, e.g. base, calc.
                          Has effect only with make distro-pack-install
  --enable-split-opt-features
                          Split file lists for some optional features, e.g.
                          pyuno, testtool. Has effect only with make
                          distro-pack-install
  --disable-cairo-canvas  Determines whether to build the Cairo canvas on
                          platforms where Cairo is available.
  --disable-dbus          Determines whether to enable features that depend on
                          dbus. e.g. Presentation mode screensaver control,
                          bluetooth presentation control, automatic font
                          install
  --disable-sdremote      Determines whether to enable Impress remote control
                          (i.e. the server component).
  --disable-sdremote-bluetooth
                          Determines whether to build sdremote with bluetooth
                          support. Requires dbus on Linux.
  --disable-gio           Determines whether to use the GIO support.
  --enable-qt5            Determines whether to use Qt5 vclplug on platforms
                          where Qt5 is available.
  --enable-kf5            Determines whether to use Qt5/KF5 vclplug on
                          platforms where Qt5 and KF5 are available.
  --enable-kde5           Compatibility switch for the kde5 => kf5 rename. Use
                          --enable-kf5!

  --enable-gtk3-kde5      Determines whether to use Gtk3 vclplug with KF5 file
                          dialogs on platforms where Gtk3, Qt5 and Plasma is
                          available.
  --disable-gui           Disable use of X11 or Wayland to reduce dependencies
                          (e.g. for building LibreOfficeKit).
  --disable-randr         Disable RandR support in the vcl project.
  --disable-gstreamer-1-0 Disable building with the gstreamer 1.0 avmedia
                          backend.
  --disable-neon          Disable neon and the compilation of webdav binding.
  --enable-eot            Enable support for Embedded OpenType fonts.
  --disable-cve-tests     Prevent CVE tests to be executed
  --enable-chart-tests    Executes chart XShape tests. In a perfect world
                          these tests would be stable and everyone could run
                          them, in reality it is best to run them only on a
                          few machines that are known to work and maintained
                          by people who can judge if a test failure is a
                          regression or not.
  --enable-build-opensymbol
                          Do not use the prebuilt opens___.ttf. Build it
                          instead. This needs fontforge installed.
  --enable-dependency-tracking
                          Do not reject slow dependency extractors.
  --disable-dependency-tracking
                          Disables generation of dependency information.
                          Speed up one-time builds.
  --enable-icecream       Use the 'icecream' distributed compiling tool to
                          speedup the compilation. It defaults to
                          /opt/icecream for the location of the icecream
                          gcc/g++ wrappers, you can override that using
                          --with-gcc-home=/the/path switch.
  --enable-ld=<linker>    Use the specified linker. Both 'gold' and 'lld'
                          linkers generally use less memory and link faster.
                          By default tries to use the best linker possible,
                          use --disable-ld to use the default linker. If
                          <linker> contains any ':', the part before the first
                          ':' is used as the value of -fuse-ld, while the part
                          after the first ':' is used as the value of
                          --ld-path (which is needed for Clang 12).
  --disable-cups          Do not build cups support.

  --disable-ccache        Do not try to use ccache automatically. By default,
                          unless on Windows, we will try to detect if ccache
                          is available; in that case if CC/CXX are not yet
                          set, and --enable-icecream is not given, we attempt
                          to use ccache. --disable-ccache disables ccache
                          completely. Additionally ccache's depend mode is
                          enabled if possible, use --enable-ccache=nodepend to
                          enable ccache without depend mode.
  --enable-online-update  Enable the online update service that will check for
                          new versions of LibreOffice. By default, it is
                          enabled on Windows and Mac, disabled on Linux. If
                          the value is "mar", the experimental Mozilla-like
                          update will be enabled instead of the traditional
                          update mechanism.
  --disable-extension-update
                          Disable possibility to update installed extensions.
  --enable-release-build  Enable release build. Note that the "release build"
                          choice is orthogonal to whether symbols are present,
                          debug info is generated, or optimization is done.
                          See
                          http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/DevBuild

  --enable-silent-msi     Enable MSI with LIMITUI=1 (silent install).
  --enable-macosx-code-signing=<identity>
                          Sign executables, dylibs, frameworks and the app
                          bundle. If you don't provide an identity the first
                          suitable certificate in your keychain is used.
  --enable-macosx-package-signing=<identity>
                          Create a .pkg suitable for uploading to the Mac App
                          Store and sign it. If you don't provide an identity
                          the first suitable certificate in your keychain is
                          used.
  --enable-macosx-sandbox Make the app bundle run in a sandbox. Requires code
                          signing. Is required by apps distributed in the Mac
                          App Store, and implies adherence to App Store rules.
  --disable-community-flavor
                          Disable the Community branding.
  --enable-readonly-installset
                          Prevents any attempts by LibreOffice to write into
                          its installation. That means at least that no
                          "system-wide" extensions can be added. Partly
                          experimental work in progress, probably not fully
                          implemented. Always enabled for macOS.
  --disable-mariadb-sdbc  Disable the build of the MariaDB/MySQL-SDBC driver.

  --disable-postgresql-sdbc
                          Disable the build of the PostgreSQL-SDBC driver.

  --disable-firebird-sdbc Disable the build of the Firebird-SDBC driver if it
                          doesn't compile for you.
  --enable-bogus-pkg-config
                          MACOSX only: on MacOSX pkg-config can cause trouble.
                          by default if one is found in the PATH, an error is
                          issued. This flag turn that error into a warning.
  --disable-openssl       Disable using libssl/libcrypto from OpenSSL. If
                          disabled, components will either use GNUTLS or NSS.
                          Work in progress, use only if you are hacking on it.
  --enable-cipher-openssl-backend
                          Enable using OpenSSL as the actual implementation of
                          the rtl/cipher.h functionality. Requires
                          --enable-openssl.
  --enable-library-bin-tar
                          Enable the building and reused of tarball of binary
                          build for some 'external' libraries. Some libraries
                          can save their build result in a tarball stored in
                          TARFILE_LOCATION. That binary tarball is uniquely
                          identified by the source tarball, the content of the
                          config_host.mk file and the content of the top-level
                          directory in core for that library If this option is
                          enabled, then if such a tarfile exist, it will be
                          untarred instead of the source tarfile, and the
                          build step will be skipped for that library. If a
                          proper tarfile does not exist, then the normal
                          source-based build is done for that library and a
                          proper binary tarfile is created for the next time.
  --disable-dconf         Disable the dconf configuration backend (enabled by
                          default where available).
  --enable-formula-logger Enable formula logger for logging formula
                          calculation flow in Calc.

  --disable-opencl        Disable OpenCL support.
  --disable-librelogo     Do not build LibreLogo.
  --disable-poppler       Disable building Poppler.

  --disable-gpgmepp       Disable building gpgmepp. Do not use in normal cases
                          unless you want to fix potential problems it causes.

  --enable-bundle-mariadb When using MariaDB/MySQL libraries already on
                          system, bundle them with the MariaDB
                          Connector/LibreOffice.

                          present in the Android NDK you are using. The
                          default (and only supported version currently) is
                          "clang5.0"
  --with-android-sdk      Specify location of the Android SDK. Mandatory when
                          building for Android.
  --with-android-api-level
                          Specify the API level when building for Android.
                          Defaults to 16 for ARM and x86 and to 21 for ARM64
                          and x86-64
  --with-valgrind         Make availability of Valgrind headers a hard
                          requirement.
  --with-update-config=/tmp/update.ini
                          Path to the update config ini file
  --with-macosx-bundle-identifier=tld.mumble.orifice.TheOffice
                          Define the macOS bundle identifier. Default is the
                          somewhat weird org.libreoffice.script ("script",
                          huh?).
  --with-product-name='My Own Office Suite'
                          Define the product name. Default is LibreOffice.
  --with-package-version='3.1.4.5'
                          Define the package version. Default is
                          7.2.0.0.alpha0+. Use only if you distribute an
                          own build for macOS.
  --with-gcc-home         Specify the location of gcc/g++ manually. This can
                          be used in conjunction with --enable-icecream when
                          icecream gcc/g++ wrappers are installed in a
                          non-default path.
  --with-gnu-patch        Specify location of GNU patch on Solaris or FreeBSD.
  --with-build-platform-configure-options
                          Specify options for the configure script run for the

                          store) tarfiles.
  --with-referenced-git=<OTHER_CHECKOUT_DIR>
                          Specify another checkout directory to reference.
                          This makes use of git submodule update --reference,
                          and saves a lot of diskspace when having multiple
                          trees side-by-side.
  --with-linked-git=<submodules repo basedir>
                          Specify a directory where the repositories of
                          submodules are located. This uses a method similar
                          to git-new-workdir to get submodules.
  --with-galleries        Specify how galleries should be built. It is
                          possible either to build these internally from

  --with-theme="theme1 theme2..."
                          Choose which themes to include. By default those
                          themes with an '*' are included. Possible choices:

                          *breeze_svg, *colibre, *colibre_svg, *elementary,
                          *elementary_svg, *karasa_jaga, *karasa_jaga_svg,
                          *sifr, *sifr_dark, *sifr_dark_svg, *sifr_svg,
                          *sukapura, *sukapura_svg.
  --without-helppack-integration
                          It will not integrate the helppacks to the installer
                          of the product. Please use this switch to use the
                          online help or separate help packages.
  --without-fonts         LibreOffice includes some third-party fonts to
                          provide a reliable basis for help content,
                          templates, samples, etc. When these fonts are
                          already known to be available on the system then you
                          should use this option.
  --with-epm              Decides which epm to use. Default is to use the one
                          from the system if one is built. When either this is
                          not there or you say =internal epm will be built.
  --with-package-format   Specify package format(s) for LibreOffice
                          installation sets. The implicit
                          --without-package-format leads to no installation
                          sets being generated. Possible values: aix, archive,
                          bsd, deb, dmg, installed, msi, pkg, and rpm.
                          Example: --with-package-format='deb rpm'
  --with-tls              Decides which TLS/SSL and cryptographic
                          implementations to use for LibreOffice's code.
                          Notice that this doesn't apply for depending
                          libraries like "neon", for example. Default is to
                          use NSS although OpenSSL is also possible. Notice
                          that selecting NSS restricts the usage of OpenSSL in
                          LO's code but selecting OpenSSL doesn't restrict by
                          now the usage of NSS in LO's code. Possible values:
                          openssl, nss. Example: --with-tls="nss"
  --with-system-libs      Use libraries already on system -- enables all

                          --with-system-* flags for external packages whose
                          headers are the only entities used i.e.
                          boost/odbc/sane-header(s).
  --without-system-jars   When building with --with-system-libs, also the
                          needed jars are expected on the system. Use this to
                          disable that
  --with-system-cairo     Use cairo libraries already on system. Happens
                          automatically for (implicit) --enable-gtk3.

                          building the Firebird-SDBC driver. If fb_config is
                          not in PATH, use FBCONFIG to point to it.

                          shared objects. Possible values: "sysv", "gnu",
                          "both". The default value is "gnu" if supported on
                          the build system, and "sysv" otherwise.
  --with-jdk-home=<absolute path to JDK home>
                          If you have installed JDK 9 or later on your system
                          please supply the path here. Note that this is not
                          the location of the java command but the location of
                          the entire distribution. In case of cross-compiling,
                          this is the JDK of the host os. Use
                          --with-build-platform-configure-options to point to
                          a different build platform JDK.
  --with-help             Enable the build of help. There is a special
                          parameter "common" that can be used to bundle only
                          the common part, .e.g help-specific icons. This is
                          useful when you build the helpcontent separately.

                          Usage:     --with-help    build the old local help
                                 --without-help     no local help (default)
                                 --with-help=html   build the new HTML local help
                                 --with-help=online build the new HTML online help

  --with-omindex          Enable the support of xapian-omega index for online
                          help.

                         Usage: --with-omindex=server prepare the pages for omindex
				but let xapian-omega be built in server.
				--with-omindex=noxap do not prepare online pages
                                for xapian-omega

  --with-java=<java command>
                          Specify the name of the Java interpreter command.
                          Typically "java" which is the default. To build
                          without support for Java components, applets,
                          accessibility or the XML filters written in Java,
                          use --without-java or --with-java=no.
  --with-jvm-path=<absolute path to parent of jvm home>
                          Use a specific JVM search path at runtime. e.g. use
                          --with-jvm-path=/usr/lib/ to find JRE/JDK in
                          /usr/lib/jvm/
  --with-ant-home=<absolute path to Ant home>
                          If you have installed Apache Ant on your system,
                          please supply the path here. Note that this is not
                          the location of the Ant binary but the location of
                          the entire distribution.
  --with-symbol-config    Configuration for the crashreport symbol upload
  --without-export-validation
                          Disable validating OOXML and ODF files as exported
                          from in-tree tests.
  --with-bffvalidator=<absolute path to BFFValidator>
                          Enables export validation for Microsoft Binary
                          formats (doc, xls, ppt). Requires installed
                          Microsoft Office Binary File Format Validator. Note:
                          export-validation (--with-export-validation) is
                          required to be turned on. See
                          https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26794
  --with-junit=<absolute path to JUnit 4 jar>
                          Specifies the JUnit 4 jar file to use for
                          JUnit-based tests. --without-junit disables those
                          tests. Not relevant in the --without-java case.
  --with-hamcrest=<absolute path to hamcrest jar>
                          Specifies the hamcrest jar file to use for
                          JUnit-based tests. --without-junit disables those
                          tests. Not relevant in the --without-java case.
  --with-perl-home=<abs. path to Perl 5 home>
                          If you have installed Perl 5 Distribution, on your
                          system, please supply the path here. Note that this
                          is not the location of the Perl binary but the
                          location of the entire distribution.
  --with-doxygen=<absolute path to doxygen executable>
                          Specifies the doxygen executable to use when
                          generating ODK C/C++ documentation.
                          --without-doxygen disables generation of ODK C/C++
                          documentation. Not relevant in the --disable-odk
                          case.
  --with-visual-studio=<2019>
                          Specify which Visual Studio version to use in case
                          several are installed. Currently only 2019 (default)
                          is supported.
  --with-windows-sdk=<8.0(A)/8.1(A)/10.0>
                          Specify which Windows SDK, or "Windows Kit", version
                          to use in case the one that came with the selected
                          Visual Studio is not what you want for some reason.
                          Note that not all compiler/SDK combinations are
                          supported. The intent is that this option should not
                          be needed.
  --with-lang="es sw tu cs sk"
                          Use this option to build LibreOffice with additional
                          UI language support. English (US) is always included
                          by default. Separate multiple languages with space.
                          For all languages, use --with-lang=ALL.
  --with-locales="en es pt fr zh kr ja"
                          Use this option to limit the locale information
                          built in. Separate multiple locales with space. Very
                          experimental and might well break stuff. Just a
                          desperate measure to shrink code and data size. By
                          default all the locales available is included. This
                          option is completely unrelated to --with-lang.

                          Affects also our character encoding conversion
                          tables for encodings mainly targeted for a
                          particular locale, like EUC-CN and EUC-TW for
                          zh, ISO-2022-JP for ja.

                          Affects also our add-on break iterator data for
                          some languages.

                          For the default, all locales, don't use this switch at all.
                          Specifying just the language part of a locale means all matching
                          locales will be included.

  --with-krb5             Enable MIT Kerberos 5 support in modules that
                          support it. By default automatically enabled on
                          platforms where a good system Kerberos 5 is
                          available.
  --with-gssapi           Enable GSSAPI support in modules that support it. By
                          default automatically enabled on platforms where a
                          good system GSSAPI is available.
  --with-iwyu             Use given IWYU binary path to check unneeded
                          includes instead of building. Use only if you are
                          hacking on it.
  --without-lxml          gla11y will use python lxml when available,
                          potentially building a local copy if necessary.
                          --without-lxml tells it to not use python lxml at
                          all, which means that gla11y will only report widget
                          classes and ids.
  --with-latest-c++       Try to enable the latest features of the C++
                          compiler, even if they are not yet part of a
                          published standard.
  --with-branding=/path/to/images
                          Use given path to retrieve branding images set.

                          make distro-pack-install
  --with-os-version=<OSVERSION>
                          For FreeBSD users, use this option to override the

  --with-idlc-cpp=<cpp/ucpp>
                          Specify the C Preprocessor to use for idlc. Default
                          is ucpp.
  --with-parallelism      Number of jobs to run simultaneously during build.
                          Parallel builds can save a lot of time on multi-cpu
                          machines. Defaults to the number of CPUs on the
                          machine, unless you configure --enable-icecream -
                          then to 40.

  --with-gdrive-client-id Provides the client id of the application for OAuth2
                          authentication on Google Drive. If either this or
                          --with-gdrive-client-secret is empty, the feature
                          will be disabled
  --with-gdrive-client-secret
                          Provides the client secret of the application for
                          OAuth2 authentication on Google Drive. If either
                          this or --with-gdrive-client-id is empty, the
                          feature will be disabled
  --with-alfresco-cloud-client-id
                          Provides the client id of the application for OAuth2
                          authentication on Alfresco Cloud. If either this or
                          --with-alfresco-cloud-client-secret is empty, the
                          feature will be disabled
  --with-alfresco-cloud-client-secret
                          Provides the client secret of the application for
                          OAuth2 authentication on Alfresco Cloud. If either
                          this or --with-alfresco-cloud-client-id is empty,
                          the feature will be disabled

                          will be disabled
  --with-onedrive-client-secret

                          be disabled
  --with-macosx-sdk=<version>
                          Prefer a specific SDK for building.

                          If the requested SDK is not available, a search for the oldest one will be done.
                          With current Xcode versions, only the latest SDK is included, so this option is
                          not terribly useful. It works fine to build with a new SDK and run the result
                          on an older OS.

                          e. g.: --with-macosx-sdk=10.10

                          there are 3 options to control the MacOSX build:
                          --with-macosx-sdk (referred as 'sdk' below)
                          --with-macosx-version-min-required (referred as 'min' below)
                          --with-macosx-version-max-allowed (referred as 'max' below)

                          the connection between these value and the default they take is as follow:
                          ( ? means not specified on the command line, s means the SDK version found,
                          constraint: 8 <= x <= y <= z)

                          ==========================================
                           command line      || config result
                          ==========================================
                          min  | max  | sdk  || min   | max  | sdk  |
                          ?    | ?    | ?    || 10.10 | 10.s | 10.s |
                          ?    | ?    | 10.x || 10.10 | 10.x | 10.x |
                          ?    | 10.x | ?    || 10.10 | 10.s | 10.s |
                          ?    | 10.x | 10.y || 10.10 | 10.x | 10.y |

                          Note: MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET will be set to the value of 'min'.

  --with-macosx-version-min-required=<version>
                          set the minimum OS version needed to run the built
                          LibreOffice

                          e. g.: --with-macosx-version-min-required=10.10
                          see --with-macosx-sdk for more info

  --with-macosx-version-max-allowed=<version>
                          set the maximum allowed OS version the LibreOffice
                          compilation can use APIs from

                          e. g.: --with-macosx-version-max-allowed=10.10
                          see --with-macosx-sdk for more info

  --with-system-icu-for-build=yes/no/force
                          Use icu already on system for build tools
